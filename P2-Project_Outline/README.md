## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am torn between two projects. Here are my ideas for each:

#### Project A: 
This application introduces users to culturally important historical sites in the St. Louis area. It's primary focus will be on the lost history of blues music in the area. Users will be able to find these sites via Google Maps, visit the site, listen to the music that was written at that particular site and learn the "lost" history associated with the site.

The idea for this application originated through conversations with a local artist and author regarding what is a perceived PR problem for St Louis City. We do not do a very good job about talking about our city. Many hugely important events happened here that we just don't know about, talk about or promote. This app will help educate people about these lost histories and increase awareness of the role of black artists and St Louis through the context of blues music.

#### Project B:
This an application that helps businesses keep track of assets that are loaned to members of their organizations. Primarily it will be used to manage inventory such as laptop computers. Assets will be entered with a barcode scanner and associated with users. It will help solve the problem of who has what assets and for how long.

The idea for this application comes from a need that my current organization has and a desire for me to create a better tool for this aspect of my role within the company. 
### Features
